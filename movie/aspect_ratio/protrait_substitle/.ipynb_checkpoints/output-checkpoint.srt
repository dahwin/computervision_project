00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Hi.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hi.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hi.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 It's dawn in Korea.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I had something spicy.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I have runny nose.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hi.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Hi.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 There are four people.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Four people came in.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hi.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 It's morning in Korea.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Morning?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 We finished our first day in England.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 We finished our first day in England.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We finished our first day in England.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Second day.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 We're out of our mind.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 The second day.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 The first day.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We finished.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Before I remove my makeup,

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I turned on the camera to do a live.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It's our first time in Europe.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I was a little worried.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I didn't expect the reaction.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I didn't expect the reaction.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's our first time in Europe.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 It's our first time in Europe.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 People sang along to our song.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 People sang along to our song.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,360
 They made it really loud, so I can't hear it well.

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,920
 You didn't have to worry about it at all.

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,160
 That's right. It was so much fun.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,200
 And at the end, I'm looking forward to it.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,920
 Video? Fans' video?

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,039
 They made it so well.

38
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,640
 Yeah, I think so.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
 They sing well, too.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
 That's right. That's right.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,320
 I sang Moonlight today.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
 Is it spicy?

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
 Yeah, it's too spicy.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,200
 I was hungry after the performance, so I ate something.

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:09,840
 I'm going to have a late-night snack.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,920
 You got up really early.

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,520
 That's right. What time is it in Korea now?

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,840
 What did you eat?

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,000
 I ate the catering.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,520
 Tofu kimchi and...

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,560
 It's a little past 10 o'clock in London.

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,280
 10 p.m.

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,560
 Oh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning.

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
 Oh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning?

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,040
 It's 6 o'clock in the morning.

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
 You got up early.

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
 It's the weekend now.

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,120
 That's right.

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,680
 No, I'm doing a live.

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,400
 Now...

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,840
 I really want to come back to England again.

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,360
 Yeah, I really wanted to come back.

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:16,640
 I could only see the outside in the car, so I was a little sad.

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
 It was so pretty.

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,160
 The building?

66
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
 Yeah, that's right.

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,720
 It's so pretty and the weather is warmer than I thought.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,840
 That's right.

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,120
 I thought it would be nice to take a walk.

70
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,520
 But I'm not lying.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,800
 I've never stepped on the ground outside.

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,440
 Really.

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,520
 I've never stepped on it since I came to England.

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,320
 Airport, hotel, concert hall.

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,600
 Like this.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:53,880
 I didn't even go to a convenience store or a mart.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,760
 Next time, we're going to...

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
 Where are we going?

79
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,400
 France.

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,280
 We're going to France.

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,920
 I'm really looking forward to it.

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:23,400
 Bonjour.

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,719
 I have to get ready to go out, but I'm not ready for Bubble Live.

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
 I'm going to be late.

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,880
 What day is it today?

86
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,120
 Are we going to hang out?

87
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
 What day is it in Korea?

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320
 Is it Saturday in Korea?

89
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,880
 Is this Friday?

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,120
 Saturday morning at 6.40?

91
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,880
 Is it Saturday, September 9th?

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 It's already September 9th?

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,719
 I think it was yesterday, September 1st.

94
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,120
 It's already September 9th.

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,760
 Chuseok is coming soon.

96
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,360
 It's been over a week since September 1st.

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
 I know.

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
 Chuseok is coming soon.

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
 October...

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,440
 October...

101
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,480
 We have something in October.

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:31,840
 It's very important.

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
 Where are you going all of a sudden?

104
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,400
 Don't go!

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,520
 My head...

106
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,440
 I can't hear you.

107
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,440
 What's so amazing is that

108
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,280
 ONCEs know my nickname.

109
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
 British ONCEs.

110
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,239
 I was so surprised.

111
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:03,359
 I was so touched.

112
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,239
 How do you know?

113
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,560
 It was so amazing.

114
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
 I was so happy.

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:27,360
 I was so happy.

116
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,240
 How are you?

117
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:39,120
 I'm fine.

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
 It was so fun.

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,560
 It was so fun.

120
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,480
 I had so much fun during the concert.

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,520
 The response was so...

122
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,760
 The response was so big.

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,560
 They sang along with me.

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
 I was so touched.

125
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,560
 Especially the last video

126
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,600
 that our fans made for us.

127
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:07,160
 I was so touched.

128
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,400
 I think I should go wash up now.

129
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,560
 See you again.

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,040
 Thank you for today.

131
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,640
 Thank you.

132
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,680
 See you again.

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,960
 Bye.

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,240
 Bye.
